[Biotech-Hunters](http://Biotech-Hunters.net) Web project
=====================================

This project is being implemented to save my writing stored on my PC from collecting much more digital dust. Character data, Works of fiction and artwork amongst other related works will be hosted and organized with this project.

There are two parts to this project, remote and local. Local is designed to run off of a node.js server while remote is static HTML and JavaScript. Content will be managed from the local server as opposed to setting up a remote system and securing it.

Project is implemented by [Christopher Hall](https://github.com/ArkahnX) and [Jason Wallace](https://github.com/Cmaster118).

Character sketches and other drawn materials are copyright and created by [Levana Yang](http://toadalpaptart.deviantart.com/).

Works of fiction have been created by myself, [Christopher Hall](https://github.com/ArkahnX), with the assistance of various editors and readers.
